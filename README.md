# Code
* This is the code for DCF-YOLO. The specific innovative points are as follows: the code for the CAS module is in cas.py, the DySample module is in dysample.py, and the Focaler-IoU loss function is included in loss.py; the model configuration file is dcf-yolo.yaml.
* If you want to use our code, you must have the following preparation under the PyTorch framework: see requirement.txt for details
* Code Guidance: Download the dataset in the **Dataset** **link**, put the  images  into "firedatset/images" ,replace the common.py in the DCF-YOLO/models folder with the common.py in the DCF-YOLO folder, and replace the loss.py in the DCF-YOLO/utils folder with the loss.py in the DCF-YOLO folder,and then run the train.py to successfully train our model.
